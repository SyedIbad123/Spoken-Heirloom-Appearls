    "Hi, I'm Jessica, the heart behind The Spoken Heirloom. This idea began with the desire to make memories last in a way that felt real, through voices, laughter, and the stories that make a family who they are.",
    "As a wife and mom of two, I see every day how quickly life moves. My phone is overflowing with little videos of my children, the way they giggle with their dad, sing to themselves while playing, or chase each other through the house. But those memories get lost in an endless scroll of photos and clips I rarely go back to. I wanted something I could actually hold, something real, something my children could one day flip through and hear the love that fills our home.",
    "That feeling became even stronger as my grandparents grew older. I've started to treasure the sound of their laughter and the stories they tell about their childhoods or the people they've loved and lost. There's a kind of beauty in hearing someone's voice that no written words can capture, and I wanted a way to keep that safe, not just for me but for generations to come.",
    "My inspiration also comes from time spent traveling through Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia on mission trips. I often think back to the warmth of those communities, how we would gather around their dinner tables, sharing laughter and food made with such love. I wish I could flip through a photo book and, with one simple tap, hear those sounds again, the joy, the kindness, the music of connection.",
    "That is what The Spoken Heirloom is really about. It is a way to bridge the gap between the moments we capture and the memories we feel. Every page, every recording, and every story becomes a thread in a family's legacy, one that can be held, heard, and passed down with love.",
